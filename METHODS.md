# Methods

`AGENTS.md` says how to run. This says **what to run, what it reaches that nothing else does, and
how to tell when it is spent** — so that a fresh assistant with no memory of last night does not
run whichever method is listed first and re-sweep ground that is already bare.

Read this before choosing. Then check what has already been done:

```
python scripts/methods_report.py --by-method     what has been run here, and what it returned
python scripts/coverage.py --five                where the unnamed assets actually are
```

---

## The registry

| # | method | reaches | run it with | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | general search | anything as *beginning + stem + ending* | `confirm_cw` | **exhausted at the committed lists.** Re-measure first — see below |
| 2 | per-prefix continuations | families the global lists cannot express | `scripts/continuations.py` → `confirm_list` | **productive.** 496 new in 51 s, first run |
| 3 | materials → images | `image`, through the strongest measured cross-type seam | `images_from_materials` | productive after any material gain |
| 4 | numbers in place | family members whose number sits mid-name | `confirm_variants` | productive; widen with `swaps` |
| 5 | family gap filling | holes between confirmed family members | `scripts/families.py --gaps` → `confirm_list` | thin (1 new in 22,594) — mostly covered by 4 |
| 6 | cross-type spelling | one type's cores spelled as another's | `scripts/cross_type.py` → `confirm_list` | **measure the seam first.** Only 2 of 12 pairs are worth it |
| 7 | sound dotted tails | everything past the first dot | `confirm_sounds` | reopened — see the sound vocabulary note |
| 8 | reading the tables and extending | whatever the community half-finished | any generator → `confirm_list` | never exhausts; depends on noticing |
| 9 | cross-game techset pairs | `techset` / `technique_set` | `techset_probe`, `techset_pair` | BO4 productive; Cold War conclusively ruled out |
| — | localize unfolding | `localizeentry` | `confirm_localize` | **off, and refuses to run.** Worthless — see dead ends |

## The shape of the problem

**Regenerate these rather than trusting them:** `python scripts/coverage.py --five`.

| | Cold War | Black Ops 4 |
|---|---|---|
| assets captured | 1,626,209 | 1,023,902 |
| filled pools | 202 | 156 |
| unnamed in pools worth searching | 204,407 | 185,686 |
| **unnamed in the five types that matter** | **136,467** | **141,889** |

Per pool, the five types, unnamed / total:

| | Cold War | Black Ops 4 |
|---|---|---|
| `image` | 46,198 / 245,235 | 60,316 / 167,360 |
| `material` | 37,758 / 158,158 | 50,551 / 122,750 |
| `xmodel` | 20,826 / 85,612 | 20,922 / 61,139 |
| `xanim` | 12,386 / 28,468 | 10,001 / 21,968 |
| sound | 19,301 / 97,217 | **99 / 100** |

Nobody has come close to finishing either, and the two games are not the same problem:

- **Cold War** is where the work has been done. Its sound pool is worth 19,301 names; Black Ops 4's
  holds a hundred assets in total, so a night of sound work there is a night thrown away.
- **Black Ops 4 is image and material rich and less than 60% named** — a larger absolute prize
  than Cold War in both, and less picked over.

Both games use the same hash and the same normalisation, so one implementation serves both, and
`--game BLKOPS04` on any search is all it takes to switch.

**Grind both.** Until recently the project ground only Cold War, because `config.toml` does not
exist in a fresh clone and the fallback was Cold War -- so a repository calling itself a Cold War
and Black Ops 4 solver had, in practice, never solved any Black Ops 4. `start` now alternates by
how many passes each game has had on the machine, findings are kept per game in `findings/<game>/`,
and `submit` opens one pull request per game titled `[BLKOPS04] findings from ...`. Setting `game`
in `config.toml` turns the alternation off and that choice is then respected.

### Two figures that were wrong, and are corrected here

> **`xmodelmesh` in Cold War is 271,840 ids, not 827,935.** The larger figure came from a line in
> `confirm_cw` that subtracted the wanted set from *every* unnamed id and attributed the whole
> difference to the mesh pool. Most of that difference was pools the machine simply was not asked
> to search — `streamkey` alone is 420,229. The line now reports the two separately.

> **An earlier version called Black Ops 4 an animation goldmine, worthless for materials, citing
> xanim 259,051 and material 100.** The pool counts had been labelled with Cold War's enum, and
> the games number their types differently. The 259,051 was `xmodelmesh`. `snapshots/*.pools.txt`
> is now correct for both, and the table above is generated from the snapshots themselves.

### What is not reachable, and why the counts shrink

**`xmodelmesh`.** A mesh name is `<model>_s1_geo_rigid_bs_` plus twenty-six characters of base32
that are a hash of the mesh itself. No rule can produce it, and leaving these in *doubles* the ids
a candidate can hit by coincidence, so they are dropped as unreachable rather than counted as work
remaining.

**Everything the tables resolve.** By far the largest saving: 1,626,209 Cold War assets narrow to
136,467 actually hunted.

---

## Duplicates are now handled by the software

The long instruction that used to live here — check `submissions/`, remove what somebody else
already sent — was correct and did not work, because a contributor cannot see a pull request that
is still open. It is now enforced instead of requested:

- `start` reads every open pull request and every merged submission, and writes what is claimed.
- `submit` re-reads them at the moment of sending and drops anything already claimed.
- Every run carries a **fingerprint** of its inputs, and a search whose fingerprint has already
  been submitted refuses to start.

Independent rediscovery is still not a finding. You no longer have to remember that.

## How to read a method

- **Builds from** — what raw material it recombines. Never thin air.
- **Reaches** — the slice of unnamed ids only this gets at. The reason to run it.
- **Run it with** — the command.
- **Spent when** — the signal it has stopped paying.

---

## 1. The general search

**Builds from** every seed there is: the published tables for this game, every name already
confirmed, everybody's merged submissions, strings scraped from a build, names borrowed from the
other game.

**Reaches** anything expressible as *beginning + stem + ending*. The workhorse and the widest net.

**Run it with** `confirm_cw`. `confirm_cw seeds` uses only confirmed names, which is small enough
to run in minutes and worth repeating after a long pass to pick up siblings.

**Measured**, 2026-08-19, Cold War, committed lists (700 beginnings, 4,800 endings), fresh clone:

```
12,395,196 distinct pieces   41.72 T equivalent candidates   1058 s   430 names
```

**Spent — and this is the important part.** That 430 is the same 430 for everybody. Five
contributors have submitted it, **byte for byte identical in every file**, because the method is
deterministic and a fresh clone gives everyone identical inputs. Two more submitted the same 372
from method 3 the same way. The fingerprint now stops the sixth.

"Spent" here is temporary, and reopening it is one command: **`python scripts/derive_lists.py`**
folds every name confirmed since into the beginnings and endings. New lists are a new fingerprint
and a genuinely different search. That is the compounding loop — **run a pass, re-measure, run
again** — and it is why a single pass judged alone means nothing.

**The sound vocabulary was missing and is now not.** `COLD_WAR_TABLES` named only the legacy
`fnv1a_xsounds.csv` (57,593 names). The twelve per-language files Saluki actually loads hold
**825,316 distinct names**, with *zero* rows in common with the legacy file. Every general pass
before this had one fourteenth of the sound vocabulary. See `docs/HASHES.md`. **The first pass
after this fix is a different search with a much larger corpus; expect it to pay.**

The engine peels endings off the wanted ids rather than appending them to stems, because the hash
runs backwards. Read the comments in `src/search.rs` before touching any of it.

## 2. Per-prefix continuations

**Builds from** every prefix that occurs in a known name, and the tokens measured to follow *that
prefix* — not the tokens that are common overall.

**Reaches** the families the global lists structurally cannot express. The general search offers
`mc/` and `i_c_t8_mp_spe_` the same 700 beginnings and 4,800 endings, when what actually follows
them has almost nothing in common.

**Run it with**

```
python scripts/continuations.py --depth 2 --cap 24 \n    | confirm_list - --label "per-prefix continuations" --script scripts/continuations.py
```

**Measured**, first run, Cold War, 2026-08-19:

```
39,490,781 candidates   51 s   1,837 matched   496 new   0.0000 expected by chance
```

**496 new names in 51 seconds, against 430 from an 18-minute exhaustive general pass.** The
generator was the bottleneck, not the search — `confirm_list` sustains 64.3 M candidates/s from a
file and saw 0.8 M/s through a Python pipe.

Directory prefixes are given the entire vocabulary rather than a capped list, because there are
only about fifty of them and they head a large share of what this recovers.

**Spent when** a round adds little *and* re-running after folding the finds back in adds little.
It is self-feeding like the general search: each new name is a new prefix and a new continuation.
Then raise `--depth` or `--cap`, which is a different search again.

## 3. Materials to images

**Builds from** confirmed and published material names.

**Reaches** `image`, through the strongest cross-type relationship there is. **Measured**:
material and image share **15,770 cores — 11.7% of material's, 12.8% of image's**, far above any
other pair. Strip `mtl_`, try `i_` plus every semantic suffix (`_c _n _g _o _m _s _r`, which are
image's seven commonest trailing tokens by a distance), and also try it with no prefix at all.

**Run it with** `images_from_materials`.

**Spent when** the confirmed material set has not grown. Purely derivative — it yields exactly
nothing on unchanged input, so run it *after* a general pass, never before.

Material names are paths, and there are **twelve** directories: `mc/ wc/ clt/ splm/ vd/ mcs/ ei/
cltp/ vdd/ el/ mcp/ ec/`. Verified against the tables — `mc/` heads 496,666 names and `ec/` heads
25. Popularity ranking keeps the first two and discards the naming of everything under the other
ten. Carry all twelve.

## 4. Numbers in place

**Builds from** confirmed names containing a number.

**Reaches** family members that beginning-stem-ending rules structurally cannot, because the number
usually sits in the *middle*. `p7_jun_brick_pillar_128` and `p7_jun_brick_pillar_32` differ where
no prefix or suffix rule can vary.

**Run it with** `confirm_variants`, or `confirm_variants swaps` to substitute whole tokens.

**This is the method that fits `xanim`.** Published xanim names run to ten and more segments, so
an ends-only rule under-reaches them badly — the middle of a ten-segment name only exists as a
stem if a nearly identical sibling was already cut. The tables hold 50,427 whole xanim names, and
walking their numbered fields in place is exactly what this does.

**Spent when** the ranges around known members have been walked past their natural end. Widen with
`swaps` before concluding it is finished.

## 5. Family gap filling

**Builds from** numbered families with two or more confirmed members, across *everybody's*
submissions rather than one run's.

**Reaches** the holes. A family with `_01`, `_02` and `_04` confirmed is evidence about `_03` that
no popularity-ranked ending list can match.

**Run it with** `python scripts/families.py --gaps | confirm_list - --label "family gap filling"`.

**Measured**: 22,594 candidates, under a second, **1 new name**. Thin, because method 4 already
walks numbered families thoroughly. Worth running anyway — it costs a second and it works across
contributors, which `confirm_variants` does not. Do not spend a night on it.

`python scripts/families.py` with no arguments is the more valuable half: it reports the shape of
what has been found, which is what suggests the next generator.

## 6. Cross-type spelling

**Builds from** the *cores* of one asset type's names — the name with its own type's decorations
stripped — spelled with another type's decorations.

**Reaches** assets whose sibling in another type is already named. **Measure the seam first**, with
`python scripts/cross_type.py --measure`. Measured shared cores, 2026-08-19:

| from → to | shared cores | share of source |
|---|---|---|
| material ↔ image | 15,770 | 11.7% / 12.8% |
| xmodel ↔ material | 3,318 | 3.5% / 2.5% |
| xanim → xmodel | 478 | 3.7% |
| xmodel → image | 195 | 0.2% |
| material ↔ xanim | 22 | 0.0% |
| image ↔ xanim | 13 | 0.0% |

**Two pairs are worth mining and the rest are not.** A model→image method or anything involving
`xanim` and a non-model type would be a night thrown away, and that is now a measurement rather
than an opinion.

**Run it with** `python scripts/cross_type.py --from xmodel --to material | confirm_list - --label
"model to material"`.

**Spent when** the source type stops gaining names.

## 7. Sound dotted tails

**Builds from** confirmed sound names and their tails, like `.rn75.pc.en.snd`.

**Reaches** sound names the general search structurally cannot, because it treats a dot as the end
of a name and can never put one back on. Everything past the first dot is invisible to every other
method.

**Run it with** `confirm_sounds`.

It searches four pools -- `sound_asset`, `sound`, `sound_bank`, `sound_duck` -- and that has been
read as scope drift. It is not. In Cold War `sound_asset` holds 97,217 ids against `sound_bank`'s
107 and `sound_duck`'s 191, so the other three widen the wanted set by **0.3%** and are peeled in
the same batch. Widening is cheap exactly when the added pools are small; widening into
`streamkey` would add 420,229 ids and quadruple the coincidence rate. `python
scripts/coverage.py` is how to tell those two cases apart, and it is what to run before widening
anything.

**Reopened.** The tail vocabulary was measured from a table holding 57,593 names when 825,316 were
available, and the two use *different* tail conventions — `.ln75.pc.all.snd` against
`.rn75.pc.<lang>.snd`. Cold War's `sound_asset` has 19,301 unnamed. Black Ops 4's sound pool has
99; do not run it there.

## 8. Reading the tables and extending them

**Builds from** what the tables already resolve — read for shape, then generate the neighbours that
are missing.

**Reaches** whatever the community half-finished. If a table holds `..._01` through `..._07` and
the game has more, this finds them. The most open-ended method here and the least automated: it is
somebody *looking* and noticing.

**Run it** by writing a generator that prints the neighbours and piping it into `confirm_list`.
That is now a script rather than a Rust binary, which is the whole reason this method is worth
listing.

**Spent when** — it does not, in the way the others do. It depends on noticing, and the tables grow.

**One trap, already paid for.** Feeding the tables in as candidate *input* is a closed loop: every
name in a table is resolved by definition, so it cannot be a find. It was 87% of `consolidate`'s
work for **zero** names. The tables are a source of *vocabulary* and an *exclusion list*, never a
candidate set.

## 9. Cross-game techset pairs, and the whole-tag sweep

**Builds from** a sibling game that ships the same thing unhashed. Black Ops III ships its
techsetdefs as plain files, and the newer games carry assets left over from it, so one material
exported from two games pairs a plain name with the newer game's hash. Three such pairs turn a
found transformation into a proof.

**Reaches** the techset pools, which nothing else touches. A techset name is `<base>#<8 hex>`, and
the tag is a 32-bit compile stamp that cannot be predicted — but 32 bits is small enough to
**sweep whole**: with per-digit hash-state reuse, all 4.29 billion tags for one base cost about two
seconds. A base is therefore *proved or conclusively ruled out*, never merely unswept.

**Run it with** `techset_probe` (a file of candidate bases) and `techset_pair` (known
`target_hash,plain_name` pairs).

Established 2026-08-18/19:

- **Black Ops 4** `technique_set` (3,597 ids, zero previously named): names are `<base>#<8hex>`
  with BO3's base vocabulary. Material-class sets carry `mc/` (`mc/lit_backlit#f4b74e85`);
  screen/2d/compute sets are bare (`zombie_blood#a60c435b`). Tags are per-permutation and
  `#a60c435b` is commonest. 1,322 names fell in the first 53-minute sweep.
- **BO4 simplified BO3's stems** — `lit_weapon` → `lit`, `lit_emissive_scroll` → `lit_emissive` —
  so trailing-qualifier truncation of known stems is a real seed transform.
- **Cold War** `techset` (7,096 unnamed): *not* reachable from BO3 stems under any 32-bit tag.
  Full sweeps of every stem × every tag came back empty, which is a conclusive no for that shape.

**Spent when** the base vocabulary stops growing. The tag side is never the problem.

> These names currently have **nowhere upstream to land** — cod-name-db has no techset table.
> Proposing one is worth more than another night of grinding. See `docs/HASHES.md`.

## Adding a method

**This is the highest-value thing anybody does here**, and it no longer requires writing Rust.
`confirm_list` takes candidate names on standard input and does the careful half. A method is a
program that prints names.

A new method earns its place by answering the **reaches** question: what slice of the unnamed ids
does it get at that nothing above does? A method that covers ground the general search already
covers is not a new method, it is a slower one.

When you add one:

1. **Name the generator when you confirm:** `confirm_list - --label "..." --script <path>`. It is
   copied into the run and `submit` puts it in the pull request under `scripts/contributed/`.
   Anything in `contrib/`, and any new file in `scripts/`, is carried too. Give it the docstring
   `scripts/README.md` asks for.
2. **Read the library first.** `start` prints every script and what it is for, so that inventing
   something that already exists under another name takes a deliberate effort rather than an
   ordinary lapse of memory.
3. Add a section here in the same shape, with the numbers your run measured.
4. Say honestly what it is spent by.
5. **If it did not work, put it in the dead ends below.** A measured negative is worth as much as
   a find, and costs the next person nothing.

---

## Order of resort

Seeded methods first, always. That is where the yield is and they compound.

Exhaustive or random character combination is a legitimate **last** resort once seeded methods are
genuinely exhausted — never a starting point. The arithmetic says why: the median confirmed name
has seven or eight underscore-separated segments, and the space of sequences that long passes 2^63
long before the name does. Past four segments the hash stops being a filter and becomes a
checksum: there are more candidate strings than there are hashes, every one an equally valid
preimage, and no amount of speed changes that. Only a prior can. Fragment recombination *is* that
prior.

If you do get there, constrain it with what has been measured — known directories, known prefixes,
known segment shapes, known endings. This is also the only regime where collisions matter: a
41.7 T candidate pass expects 0.617 coincidental matches, and a seeded pass of forty million
expects 0.0000. Every binary prints the figure.

---

## Dead ends

Do not spend a night rediscovering these. Each cost real time.

| Tried | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Scanning `xsub` files for names | They hold none. 85 GB of nothing. |
| A NUL-terminated-only string scanner over xpak/ff/fd | Misses roughly 800,000 names. |
| Salsa20 for the encrypted fast files | Wrong cipher. It is AES-256-CTR, little-endian counter. |
| Training a name classifier on the `_v2` tables | Those are MW2022/BO6 and teach the wrong conventions. |
| Stripping `_geo_rigid_bs_` as its own rule | Underscore truncation already covers it, and mesh names are unobtainable anyway. |
| Feeding the hash tables in as candidate input | A closed loop. 87% of `consolidate`'s work, zero names. |
| Hunting `localizeentry` | The entry holds a pointer to its own unhashed string — the plain text is already in the build. 8,667 confirmed in one pass, all worthless. `confirm_localize` now refuses to run. |
| Hunting `streamkey` | ~290,000 genuine, useless hashes, mostly sequential `d3dbsp` terrain. The largest pool in both games, so anything that "opens up every pool" lands here first. `submit` refuses to send them. |
| Widening `pools` to ~40 asset types by guesswork | One submission did. Nothing useful came of it, and the real findings were buried among the rest. |
| Searching four pools because they had "sound" in the name | `sound`, `sound_asset`, `sound_bank`, `sound_duck`. Only `sound_asset` is worth anything, and only in Cold War. |
| Cross-type generation involving `xanim` and a non-model type | Measured: 13 to 22 shared cores out of tens of thousands. There is no seam. |
| Reading candidates with `BufRead::lines()` | Not a search dead end but the same lesson: the `String` per candidate *was* the program, capping `confirm_list` at 5.2M/s against 64.3M/s for raw bytes. |

---

## What is still not recorded

The fingerprint records that a *configuration* was swept. It does not record which *ranges* within
a method were swept — so `confirm_variants` walking `_01` to `_64` of one family and stopping is
still invisible to the next assistant.

That is the obvious next improvement to how this project remembers itself, and it is smaller than
it looks now that `RunNote` carries arbitrary measurements: a method that records the ranges it
covered into its run note would make this file far more useful than it currently is.

//! The set of asset ids a game holds, as a file that outlives the loader.
//!
//! This is the whole reason someone without the game can take part. Confirming a name asks one
//! question -- is this hash the id of an asset the game holds -- and that question is answered
//! by a set of numbers, not by the game. Captured once by someone running Cordycep, the set
//! travels: any machine, any platform, no loader, no install.
//!
//! The format is deliberately dull. Ids are stored sorted so a lookup is a binary search over a
//! memory mapped slice rather than a hash map that has to be built first, and a record carries
//! the pool it was found in so a confirmed name can be filed by type. An id held in several
//! pools is several records, which is how a model that also has a skeleton and a collision comes
//! back as all three.

//! Files every string anywhere under the harvest folder by the pool the loader holds it in.
//!
//! The results of this work accumulated across a dozen run folders, a separate by-type folder
//! and a few loose files, in two different row formats and two different line endings. Merging
//! those by hand means deciding, for each file, which asset type it holds -- and one wrong
//! decision puts hashes in the wrong table, which is the one mistake that is expensive to undo.
//!
//! So no such decision is made. The asset type of a name is not a property of the file it was
//! found in; it is a property of the hash, and the loader is holding the answer. Every string is
//! taken from every file with its stored hash thrown away, hashed here, and looked for among the
//! loaded ids. Where it is found, the pool it was found in names the type. A file name never
//! gets a vote, so a misfiled row in the input cannot become a misfiled row in the output.
//!
//! Two things this is deliberately exhaustive about, because a partial answer here looks exactly
//! like a complete one:
//!
//! **Every pool, not the named ones.** `POOLS` names thirty three asset types and every earlier
//! search walked exactly those. The loader allocates `POOL_COUNT`, and Cold War fills far more
//! than thirty three of them. A pool this project never named still holds assets whose ids a
//! candidate can match, so all of them are walked and the unnamed ones are filed under their
//! index.
//!
//! **Every file, not the text ones.** A `.csv`, a `.log`, even a database, holds strings, and a
//! string is a candidate wherever it is written down. Files are read as bytes and split into
//! runs of printable characters, which treats text and binary alike and cannot skip a file for
//! being the wrong shape.
//!
//! What is left is whether a found name is a *discovery*, and the published tables answer that:
//! a hash any of them already resolves is known to the community, whoever found it. Only what
//! they do not resolve is written.
//!
//! Writing is append-only. Rewriting a result file has silently destroyed a result set here
//! before, so this never truncates one: it reads what is there, and adds only what is missing.

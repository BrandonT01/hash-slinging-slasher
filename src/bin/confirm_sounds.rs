//! Recovers sound asset names, which are a path with a fixed set of tails on the end.
//!
//! A sound asset is named
//! `vox/scripted/mpl/ngs2/vox_ngs2_ss_gunship_40_kill_1_01.rn75.pc.en.snd`. Everything from the
//! first dot is a tail out of a closed set: a two letter marker, `75`, the platform, the
//! language, `snd`. There are a couple of hundred such tails across every sound table, and the
//! same recording exists under most of them.
//!
//! The general search cannot reach these at all: it cuts its pieces at underscores and slashes
//! and treats a dot as the end of a name, so it can never put a dotted tail back on. That is why
//! tens of thousands of the game's sound assets are unnamed while the tables hold most of the
//! recordings under some other tail.
//!
//! The tails are measured, never guessed -- every distinct one any sound table holds, however
//! rarely, since the whole list is small enough to be free. The stems are every sound name with
//! its tail taken off, from the tables and from what was scraped out of the builds.

/// The pools a sound name can land in.
///
/// Four pools rather than one, and a submission saying "searched 4 pools: sound, sound_asset,
/// sound_bank, sound_duck" has been read as scope drift. It is not, and the numbers are the whole
/// argument: in Cold War `sound_asset` holds 97,217 ids while `sound_bank` holds 107 and
/// `sound_duck` 191, and `sound` is not a filled pool at all. Adding the other three widens the
/// wanted set by **0.3%**, which is free -- they are peeled in the same batch as the rest -- and
/// they are real sound names when they land.
///
/// The rule this illustrates is worth keeping: widening is only cheap when the pools being added
/// are small. Widening into `streamkey` would add 420,229 ids, quadrupling the wanted set and the
/// coincidence rate with it. `python scripts/coverage.py` is how to tell the two cases apart, and
/// it should be run before adding anything here.

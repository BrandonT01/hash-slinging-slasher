//! Derives image names from material names.
//!
//! An image is usually named for the material that uses it, with a map suffix on the end and a
//! different beginning: a material called `mc/mtl_wpn_t9_ak47_barrel` has images called
//! `i_wpn_t9_ak47_barrel_c`, `..._n`, `..._g` and so on. So the material tables, which are
//! published and complete, describe images that are not.
//!
//! That makes this a far narrower search than the general one. There is no scraping and no
//! guessing at what a name might be: the stem comes from a material known to exist, and the
//! ending comes from a table, which is asked for every ending it holds rather than only the
//! common ones. Both tables are read for endings, because an ending is an ending whichever kind
//! of asset it was seen on, and the material table holds two hundred thousand the image table
//! does not.

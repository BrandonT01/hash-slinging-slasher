//! The gate every search passes through, so that "did you update first?" stops being a question
//! anybody has to remember to ask.
//!
//! The instruction to bring the clone up to date has been in the documentation from the start.
//! It gets skipped anyway -- not out of carelessness, but because an assistant arriving at a repo
//! full of promising things to run has a dozen instructions competing for the same attention, and
//! this one looks like housekeeping rather than like the thing the night depends on.
//!
//! So it is not an instruction here. `start` writes a receipt; a search reads it and refuses to
//! run without a current one. There is exactly one thing to remember, and forgetting it produces
//! an error in the first second rather than a wasted night discovered at four in the morning.
